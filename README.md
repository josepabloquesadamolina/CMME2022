# Computational Modeling for Materials Engineering
## Practice sessions: Deep Learning Applications in the field of Materials Engineering
### Instructions: 
- Download the files and place them in the default working directory of Jupyter Notebook (typically *C:\Users\<username>*). 
- Extract the .zip files before attemping to run the Jupyter Notebook files.
### **Session 1**
- Brief Introduction to basic concepts: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning Paradigms, Deep Learning, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Gradient Descent Algorithm, Challenges during the Training, Regularization Techniques, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- Study case: *Structure-Property Mappings* for Polysilicon Thin-Films found in MEMS.
- Downloading and installing required software and packages for ML and DL (Miniconda, TensorFlow, Jupyter Notebook, etc.)
### **Session 2**
- Overview of available resources: Keras API, Google Colab.
- Example 1:  *Classification task* example code available from Keras API and running directly on Google Colab. Illustration of basic introduced concepts.
## **Session 3**
- Example 2:  Starting from the example seen last class, an overview of underfitting and overfitting will be done by introducing modifications in the code in order to induce these problems. Assessment of both scenarios will be done via Loss-Epoch plots.
- In the second part of the example, modifications in the code will be introduced to illustrate how a CNN can be used for a *regression task*, that is, to achieve a mapping between an image and a numerical value. Instead of producing a vector of probabilities from which the class is later inferred, the model will output a numeric value directly, corresponding to the prediction of the digit itself.
