# Computational Modeling for Materials Engineering
## Practice sessions: Deep Learning Applications in the field of Materials Engineering
### Instructions: 
- Download the files and place them in the default working directory of Jupyter Notebook (typically *C:\Users\<username>*). 
- Extract the .zip files before attemping to run the Jupyter Notebook files.
### **Session 1**
- Brief Introduction to basic concepts: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning Paradigms, Deep Learning, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Gradient Descent Algorithm, Challenges during the Training, Regularization Techniques, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- Study case: *Structure-Property Mappings* for Polysilicon Thin-Films found in MEMS.
- Downloading and installing required software and packages for ML and DL (Miniconda, TensorFlow, Jupyter Notebook, etc.)
### **Session 2**
- Overview of available resources: Keras API, Google Colab.
- Example 1:  *Classification task* example code available from Keras API and running directly on Google Colab. Illustration of basic introduced concepts.
## **Session 3**
- Example 2: Converting a classification task into a regression task. Overview of Underfitting and Overfitting problems. Assessment of the training evolution via Loss-Epoch plot.
